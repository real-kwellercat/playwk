# PlayWK

A virus, made by real-kwellercat for fun. It's a windowkill 2 challenge, which makes you play the game for 5 minutes and then lets you close it. 

NON-DESTRUCTIVE - If running in a VM, please install [the newest build of Mesa3D LLVMPipe](https://github.com/pal1000/mesa-dist-win/releases).

You can get the game's version 2 from [here.](https://torcado.itch.io/windowkill) It's a pretty good game, and version 3 comes out on 2/23/2024!

Change your PFP to [this](vmpfp-malware-testing.jpg) for full immersion. Sadly, I cannot change your PFP for you, so we are making you do it yourself.

It should look something like this:

Next, put windowkill-vulkan.exe and windowkill-opengl.bat in the folder "C:\WK" 

Run the program with `py main.py`. You have 5 minutes to play.
